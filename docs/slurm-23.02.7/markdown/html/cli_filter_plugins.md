# <span id="top">cli_filter Plugin API</span>

## Overview

This document describes Slurm cli_filter plugins and the API that defines them. It is intended as a
resource to programmers wishing to write their own Slurm cli_filter plugins.

The purpose of the cli_filter plugins is to provide programmatic hooks during the execution of the
**salloc**, **sbatch**, and **srun** command line interface (CLI) programs. Three hooks are defined:

- **cli_filter_p_setup_defaults** — Called before any option processing is done, *per job
  component*, allowing a plugin to replace default option values.

- **cli_filter_p_pre_submit** — Called after option processing *per job component* but before any
  communication is made with the slurm controller. This location is ideal for policy enforcement
  because the plugin can read all the options supplied by the user (as well as the environment) -
  thus invalid job requests can be stopped before they ever reach the slurmctld.

- **cli_filter_p_post_submit** — Called after the jobid (and, in the case of **srun**, after the
  stepid) is generated, and typically before or in parallel with job execution. In combination with
  data collected in the cli_filter_p_pre_submit() hook, this is an ideal location for logging
  activity.

  cli_filter plugins vary from the [job_submit plugin](job_submit_plugins.md) as it is entirely
  executed client-side, whereas job_submit is processed server-side (within the slurm controller).
  The benefit of the cli_filter is that it has access to all command line options in a simple and
  consistent interface as well as being safer to run disruptive operations (e.g., quota checks or
  other long running operations you might want to use for integrating policy decisions), which can
  be problematic if run from the controller. The disadvantage of the cli_filter is that it must not
  be relied upon for security purposes as an enterprising user can circumvent it simply by providing
  an alternate slurm.conf with the CliFilterPlugins option disabled. If you plan to use the
  cli_filter for managing policies, you should also configure a job_submit plugin to reinforce those
  policies.

  Slurm cli_filter plugins must conform to the Slurm Plugin API with the following specifications:

  <span class="commandline">const char plugin_name\[\]="*full text name*"</span>

  A free-formatted ASCII text string that identifies the plugin.

  <span class="commandline">const char plugin_type\[\]="*major/minor*"</span>  

  The major type must be "cli_filter." The minor type can be any suitable name for the type of job
  submission package. We include samples in the Slurm distribution for

  - **none** — An empty plugin with no actions taken, a useful starting template for a new plugin.

  <span class="commandline">const uint32_t plugin_version</span>  
  If specified, identifies the version of Slurm used to build this plugin and any attempt to load
  the plugin from a different version of Slurm will result in an error. If not specified, then the
  plugin may be loaded by Slurm commands and daemons from any version, however this may result in
  difficult to diagnose failures due to changes in the arguments to plugin functions or changes in
  other Slurm functions used by the plugin.

  Slurm can be configured to use multiple cli_filter plugins if desired, however the lua plugin will
  only execute one lua script named "cli_filter.lua" located in the default script directory
  (typically the subdirectory "etc" of the installation directory).

  ## API Functions

  All of the following functions are required. Functions which are not implemented must be stubbed.

  int init(void)

  **Description**:  
  Called when the plugin is loaded, before any other functions are called. Put global initialization
  here.

  **Returns**:  
  <span class="commandline">SLURM_SUCCESS</span> on success, or  
  <span class="commandline">SLURM_ERROR</span> on failure.

  void fini(void)

  **Description**:  
  Called when the plugin is removed. Clear any allocated storage here.

  **Returns**: None.

  **Note**: These init and fini functions are not the same as those described in the
  <span class="commandline">dlopen (3)</span> system library. The C run-time system co-opts those
  symbols for its own initialization. The system <span class="commandline">\_init()</span> is called
  before the Slurm <span class="commandline">init()</span>, and the Slurm
  <span class="commandline">fini()</span> is called before the system's
  <span class="commandline">\_fini()</span>.

  int cli_filter_p_setup_defaults(slurm_opt_t \*options, bool early)

  **Description**:  
  This function is called by the salloc, sbatch, or srun command line interface (CLI) programs
  shortly before processing any options from the environment, command line, or script (#SBATCH). The
  hook may be run multiple times per job component, once for an early pass (if implemented by the
  CLI), and again for the main pass. Note that this call is skipped for any srun command run within
  an existing job allocation to prevent settings from overriding the set of options that have been
  populated for the job based on the job environment. The options and early arguments are meant to
  be passed to **slurm_option_set()** which will set the option if it is in the appropriate pass.
  Failures to set an option may be a symptom of trying to set the option on the wrong pass. Given
  that you should not return SLURM_ERROR simply because of a failure to set an option.

  **Arguments**:  
  <span class="commandline">options</span> (input) slurm option data structure; meant to be passed
  to the slurm_option\_\* API within *src/common/slurm_opt.h*.  
  <span class="commandline">early</span> (input) boolean indicating if this is the early pass or
  not; meant to be passed to the slurm_option\_\* API within *src/common/slurm_opt.h*.  

  **Returns**:  
  <span class="commandline">SLURM_SUCCESS</span> on success, or  
  <span class="commandline">SLURM_ERROR</span> on failure, will terminate execution of the CLI.

  int cli_filter_p_pre_submit(slurm_opt_t \*options, int offset)

  **Description**:  
  This function is called by the CLI after option processing but before any communication with the
  slurmctld is made. This is after all cli_filter_p_setup_defaults() hooks are executed (for the
  current job component), environment variables processed, command line options and \#SBATCH
  directives interpreted. cli_filter_p_pre_submit() is called before any parts of the data structure
  are rewritten, so it is safe to both read and write or unset any options from the plugin that you
  desire. Note that cli_filter_p_post_submit() cannot safely read (or write) the options, so you
  should save any state for logging in cli_filter_p_post_submit() during cli_filter_p_pre_submit().
  This function is called once per job component.

  **Arguments**:  
  <span class="commandline">options</span> (input/output) the job allocation request
  specifications.  
  <span class="commandline">offset</span> (input) integer value for the current hetjob offset;
  should be used as a key when storing data for communication between cli_filter_p_pre_submit() and
  cli_filter_p_post_submit().  

  **Returns**:  
  <span class="commandline">SLURM_SUCCESS</span> on success, or  
  <span class="commandline">SLURM_ERROR</span> on failure, will terminate execution of the CLI.

  void cli_filter_p_post_submit(int offset, uint32_t jobid, uint32_t stepid)

  **Description**:  
  This function is called by the CLI after a jobid (and, if srun, a stepid) has been assigned by the
  controller. It is no longer safe to read or write to the options data structure, so it has been
  removed from this function. You should save any state you need in cli_filter_p_pre_submit() using
  het_job_offset as a key, since the function is called separately for every job component, and
  access it here.

  **Arguments**:  
  <span class="commandline">offset</span> (input) integer value for the current hetjob offset;
  should be used as a key when storing data for communication between cli_filter_p_pre_submit() and
  cli_filter_p_post_submit().  
  <span class="commandline">jobid</span> (input) job id of the job  
  <span class="commandline">stepid</span> (input) step id of the job if appropriate, NO_VAL
  otherwise  

  ## LUA Interface

  Setting **CliFilterPlugins=cli_filter/lua** in slurm.conf will allow you to implement the API
  functions mentioned using Lua language. The file must be named "cli_filter.lua" and, similar to
  the job_submit plugin, it must be located in the default configuration directory (typically the
  subdirectory "etc" of the installation). An example is provided within the source code
  [here](https://github.com/SchedMD/slurm/blob/master/etc/cli_filter.lua.example).

  **NOTE**: Although available options are defined in the struct
  <span class="commandline">slurm_opt_t</span> within *src/common/slurm_opt.h*, some options might
  be renamed. The provided example shows a way of displaying the configured options by using
  <span class="commandline">slurm.json_cli_options(options)</span>.
