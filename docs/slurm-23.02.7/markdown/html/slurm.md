# Slurm Workload Manager

Slurm is an open-source workload manager designed for Linux clusters of all sizes. It provides three
key functions. First it allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources (computer
nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform work. Second, it provides a framework
for starting, executing, and monitoring work (typically a parallel job) on a set of allocated nodes.
Finally, it arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of pending work.

Slurm's design is very modular with dozens of optional plugins. In its simplest configuration, it
can be installed and configured in a couple of minutes (see [Caos NSA and Perceus: All-in-one
Cluster Software Stack](http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7239/1/) by Jeffrey B. Layton). More complex
configurations can satisfy the job scheduling needs of world-class computer centers and rely upon a
[MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) database for archiving [accounting](accounting.md) records, managing
[resource limits](resource_limits.md) by user or bank account, or supporting sophisticated [job
prioritization](priority_multifactor.md) algorithms.

While other workload managers do exist, Slurm is unique in several respects:

- **Scalability**: It is designed to operate in a heterogeneous cluster with up to tens of millions
  of processors.
- **Performance**: It can accept 1,000 job submissions per second and fully execute 500 simple jobs
  per second (depending upon hardware and system configuration).
- **Free and Open Source**: Its source code is freely available under the [GNU General Public
  License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).
- **Portability**: Written in C with a GNU autoconf configuration engine. While initially written
  for Linux, Slurm has been ported to a diverse assortment of systems.
- **Power Management**: Job can specify their desired CPU frequency and power use by job is
  recorded. Idle resources can be powered down until needed.
- **Fault Tolerant**: It is highly tolerant of system failures, including failure of the node
  executing its control functions.
- **Flexibility**: A plugin mechanism exists to support various interconnects, authentication
  mechanisms, schedulers, etc. These plugins are documented and simple enough for the motivated end
  user to understand the source and add functionality.
- **Resizable Jobs**: Jobs can grow and shrink on demand. Job submissions can specify size and time
  limit ranges.
- **Status Jobs**: Status running jobs at the level of individual tasks to help identify load
  imbalances and other anomalies.

Slurm provides workload management on many of the most powerful computers in the world. On the
November 2013 [Top500](http://www.top500.org) list, five of the ten top systems use Slurm including
the number one system. These five systems alone contain over 5.7 million cores. A few of the systems
using Slurm are listed below:
