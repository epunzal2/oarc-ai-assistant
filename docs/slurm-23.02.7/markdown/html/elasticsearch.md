# Elasticsearch Guide

Slurm provides multiple Job Completion Plugins. These plugins are an orthogonal way to provide
historical job [accounting](accounting.md) data for finished jobs.

In most installations, Slurm is already configured with an
[AccountingStorageType](slurm.conf.md#OPT_AccountingStorageType) plugin — usually **slurmdbd**. In
these situations, the information captured by a completion plugin is intentionally redundant.

The **jobcomp/elasticsearch** plugin can be used together with a web layer on top of the
Elasticsearch server — such as [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) — to visualize your
finished jobs and the state of your cluster. Some of these visualization tools also let you easily
create different types of dashboards, diagrams, tables, histograms and/or apply customized filters
when searching.

## Prerequisites

The plugin requires additional libraries for compilation:

- [libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl) development files
- [JSON-C](download.md#json)

## Configuration

The Elasticsearch instance should be running and reachable from the multiple
[SlurmctldHost](slurm.conf.md#OPT_SlurmctldAddr) configured. Refer to the [Elasticsearch Official
Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/) for further details on setup and configuration.

There are three [slurm.conf](slurm.conf.md) options related to this plugin:

- [**JobCompType**](slurm.conf.md#OPT_JobCompType) is used to select the job completion plugin type
  to activate. It should be set to **jobcomp/elasticsearch**.

      JobCompType=jobcomp/elasticsearch

- [**JobCompLoc**](slurm.conf.md#OPT_JobCompLoc) should be set to the Elasticsearch server URL
  endpoint (including the port number and the target index).

      JobCompLoc=<host>:<port>/<target>/_doc

  **NOTE**: Since Elasticsearch 8.0 the APIs that accept types are removed, thereby moving to a
  typeless mode. The Slurm elasticsearch plugin in versions prior to 20.11 removed any trailing
  slashes from this option URL and appended a hardcoded **/slurm/jobcomp** suffix representing the
  */index/type* respectively. Starting from Slurm 20.11 the URL is fully configurable and handed
  as-is without modification to the libcurl library functions. In addition, this also allows users
  to index data from different clusters to the same server but to different indices.

  **NOTE**: The Elasticsearch official documentation provides detailed information around these
  concepts, the type to typeless deprecation transition as well as reindex API references on how to
  copy data from one index to another if needed.

- [**DebugFlags**](slurm.conf.md#OPT_DebugFlags) could include the **Elasticsearch** flag for extra
  debugging purposes.

      DebugFlags=Elasticsearch

  It is a good idea to turn this on initially until you have verified that finished jobs are
  properly indexed. Note that you do not need to manually create the Elasticsearch *index*, since
  the plugin will automatically do so when trying to index the first job document.

## Visualization

Once jobs are being indexed, it is a good idea to use a web visualization layer to analyze the data.
[**Kibana**](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) is a recommended open-source data visualization
plugin for Elasticsearch. Once installed, an Elasticsearch *index* name or pattern has to be
configured to instruct Kibana to retrieve the data. Once data is loaded it is possible to create
tables where each row is a finished job, ordered by any column you choose — the @end_time timestamp
is suggested — and any dashboards, graphs, or other analysis of interest.

## Testing and Debugging

For debugging purposes, you can use the **curl** command or any similar tool to perform REST
requests against Elasticsearch directly. Some of the following examples using the **curl** tool may
be useful.

Query information assuming a **slurm** *index* name, including the document count (which should be
one per job indexed):

    $ curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices/slurm?v
    health status index uuid                   pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size
    yellow open   slurm 103CW7GqQICiMQiSQv6M_g   5   1          9            0    142.8kb        142.8kb

Query all indexed jobs in the **slurm** *index*:

    $ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/slurm/_search?pretty=true&q=*:*' | less

Delete the **slurm** *index* (caution!):

    $ curl -XDELETE http://localhost:9200/slurm
    {"acknowledged":true}

Query information about **\_cat** options. More can be found in the official documentation.

    $ curl -XGET http://localhost:9200/_cat

## Failure management

When the primary slurmctld is shut down, information about all completed but not yet indexed jobs
held within the Elasticsearch plugin saved to a file named **elasticsearch_state**, which is located
in the [StateSaveLocation](slurm.conf.md#OPT_StateSaveLocation). This permits the plugin to restore
the information when the slurmctld is restarted, and will be sent to the Elasticsearch database when
the connection is restored.
