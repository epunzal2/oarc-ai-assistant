# "Configless" Slurm

"Configless" Slurm is a feature that allows the compute nodes — specifically the slurmd process —
and user commands running on login nodes to pull configuration information directly from the
slurmctld instead of from a pre-distributed local file. Your cluster does require a central set of
configuration files on the Slurm controllers — "configless" in Slurm's parlance means that the
compute nodes, login nodes, and other cluster hosts do not need to be deployed with local copies of
these files.

The slurmd on startup will reach out to a slurmctld that you specify and the config files will be
pulled to the node. This slurmctld can be identified by either an explicit option, or — preferably —
through DNS SRV records defined within the cluster itself.

If you have a login node you will be running client commands from, those client commands will have
to use the DNS record to get the configuration information from the controller when they run. If you
expect to have a lot of traffic from a login node, this can generate a lot of requests for the
configuration files. In cases like this, you may want to consider running slurmd on the machine so
it can manage the configuration files, but not allowing it to run jobs.

## Installation

There are no extra steps required to install this feature. It is built in by default starting with
Slurm 20.02.

## Setup

The slurmctld must first be configured to run in the configless mode. This is handled by setting
**SlurmctldParameters=enable_configless** in slurm.conf and restarting slurmctld.

Once enabled, you must configure the slurmd to get its configs from the slurmctld. This can be
accomplished either by launching slurmd with the **--conf-server** option, or by setting a DNS SRV
record and ensuring there is no local configuration file on the compute node.

The **--conf-server** options takes precedence over the DNS record.

The command line option takes "\$host\[:\$port\]", so an example would look like:

    slurmd --conf-server slurmctl-primary:6817

Specifying the port is optional and will default to 6817 if it is not present. Multiple slurmctlds
can be specified as a comma-separated list, in priority order (highest to lowest).

    slurmd --conf-server slurmctl-primary:6817,slurmctl-secondary

The same information can be provided in a DNS SRV record. For example:

    _slurmctld._tcp 3600 IN SRV 10 0 6817 slurmctl-backup
    _slurmctld._tcp 3600 IN SRV 0 0 6817 slurmctl-primary

Will provide the required information to the slurmd on startup. As shown above, multiple SRV records
can be specified if you have deployed Slurm in an HA setup. The DNS SRV entry with the lowest
priority should be your primary slurmctld, with higher priority values for backup slurmctlds.

## Initial Testing

With the slurmctld configured and slurmd started, you can check in a couple places to make sure the
configs are present on the node. Config files will be in **SlurmdSpoolDir** under the
**/conf-cache/**, and a symlink to this location will be created automatically in
**/run/slurm/conf**. You can confirm that reloading is working by adding a comment to your
slurm.conf on the slurmctld node and running <span class="commandline">scontrol reconfig</span> and
checking that the config was updated.

## Limitations

Using "%n" in "SlurmdSpoolDir" or "SlurmdPidFile" will not be properly substituted for the NodeName
unless slurmd is also launched with the "-N" option.

If you are using systemd to launch slurmd, you must ensure that "ConditionPathExists=\*" is not
present in the unit file or the slurmd will not start. (The example slurmd.service file shipped in
Slurm 20.02 and above does not include this entry.)

If any of the supported config files "Include" additional config files, the Included configs will
**ONLY** be shipped if their "Include" filename reference has no path separators and the file is
located adjacent to slurm.conf. Any additional config files will need to be shared a different way
or added to the parent config.

## Notes

The order of precedence for determining what configuration source to use is as follows:

1.  The slurmd --conf-server \$host\[:\$port\] option
2.  The -f \$config_file option
3.  The SLURM_CONF environment variable (if set)
4.  A local slurm config file:
    1.  The default slurm config file (likely /etc/slurm.conf)
    2.  For user commands, a cached slurm config file (run/slurm/conf/slurm.conf)
5.  The SLURM_CONF_SERVER environment variable (if set)
6.  Any DNS SRV records (from lowest priority value to highest)

Supported configuration files are:

- slurm.conf
- acct_gather.conf
- cgroup.conf
- cli_filter.lua
- ext_sensors.conf
- gres.conf
- helpers.conf
- job_container.conf
- knl_cray.conf
- knl_generic.conf
- mpi.conf
- oci.conf
- plugstack.conf
- topology.conf
