Slurm source can be downloaded from <https://www.schedmd.com/downloads.php>.  
Slurm has also been packaged for [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=slurm-wlm) and
[Ubuntu](http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=slurm-wlm) (named *slurm-wlm*),
[Fedora](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/slurm), and [NetBSD](http://www.pkgsrc.org) (in pkgsrc)
and [FreeBSD](http://www.freshports.org/sysutils/slurm-wlm/).

## Related Software

Note that the following software is not written or maintained by SchedMD. Some of the software is
required for certain functionality (e.g. MySQL or MariaDB are required to use slurmdbd) while other
software was written to provide additional functionality for users or administrators.

- **Authentication** plugins identifies the user originating a message.
  - **MUNGE** (recommended)  
    In order to compile the "auth/munge" authentication plugin for Slurm, you will need to build and
    install MUNGE, available from <https://dun.github.io/munge/> and
    [Debian](http://packages.debian.org/src:munge) and [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) and
    [Ubuntu](http://packages.ubuntu.com/src:munge).

- **Authentication** tools for users that work with Slurm.
  - [AUKS](https://github.com/hautreux/auks)  
    AUKS is an utility designed to ease Kerberos V credential support addition to non-interactive
    applications, like batch systems (Slurm, LSF, Torque, etc.). It includes a plugin for the Slurm
    workload manager. AUKS is not used as an authentication plugin by the Slurm code itself, but
    provides a mechanism for the application to manage Kerberos V credentials.

- **Databases** can be used to store accounting information. See our [Accounting](accounting.md) web
  page for more information.
  - [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/)
  - [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)

    

- **DRMAA (Distributed Resource Management Application API)**  
  [PSNC DRMAA](https://github.com/psnc-apps/slurm-drmaa) for Slurm is an implementation of [Open
  Grid Forum](http://www.gridforum.org/) [DRMAA 1.0](http://www.drmaa.org/) (Distributed Resource
  Management Application API) [specification](http://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.133.pdf) for
  submission and control of jobs to [Slurm](slurm.md). Using DRMAA, grid applications builders,
  portal developers and ISVs can use the same high-level API to link their software with different
  cluster/resource management systems.  
    
  There is a variant of PSNC DRMAA providing support for Slurm's --cluster option available from
  <https://github.com/natefoo/slurm-drmaa>.  
    
  Perl 6 DRMAA bindings are available from <https://github.com/scovit/Scheduler-DRMAA>.
    

- **Hardware topology**
  - [Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc)](http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/)
  - **NOTE**: If you build Slurm or any MPI stack component with hwloc, note that versions 2.5.0
    through 2.7.0 (inclusive) of hwloc have a bug that pushes an untouchable value into the environ
    array, causing a segfault when accessing it. It is advisable to build with hwloc version 2.7.1
    or later.
  - Used by slurmd and PMIx client to get hardware topology information.

- **Hostlist**  
  A Python program used for manipulation of Slurm hostlists including functions such as intersection
  and difference. Download the code from:  
  <http://www.nsc.liu.se/~kent/python-hostlist>  
    
  Lua bindings for hostlist functions are also available here:  
  <https://github.com/grondo/lua-hostlist>  
  **NOTE**: The Lua hostlist functions do not support the bracketed numeric ranges anywhere except
  at the end of the name (i.e. "tux\[0001-0100\]" and "rack\[0-3\]\_blade\[0-63\]" are not
  supported).
    

- **MPI** versions supported
  - [Intel MPI](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mpi-library)
  - [MPICH (a.k.a. MPICH2 / MPICH2)](https://www.mpich.org/)
  - [MVAPICH (a.k.a MVAPICH2)](http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/)
  - [Open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org)

- **Command wrappers**  
  There is a wrapper for Maui/Moab's showq command [here](https://github.com/pedmon/slurm_showq).
    

- **Scripting interfaces**
  - A **Perl** interface is included in the Slurm distribution in the *contribs/perlapi* directory
    and packaged in the *perlapi* RPM.
  - [PySlurm](https://github.com/pyslurm/) is a Python/Cython module to interface with Slurm. There
    is also a Python module to expand and collect hostlist expressions available
    [here](http://www.nsc.liu.se/~kent/python-hostlist/).

    

- **SPANK Plugins**  
  SPANK provides a very generic interface for stackable plug-ins which may be used to dynamically
  modify the job launch code in Slurm. SPANK plugins may be built without access to Slurm source
  code. They need only be compiled against Slurm‘s spank.h header file, added to the SPANK config
  file plugstack.conf, and they will be loaded at runtime during the next job launch. Thus, the
  SPANK infrastructure provides administrators and other developers a low cost, low effort ability
  to dynamically modify the runtime behavior of Slurm job launch. Additional documentation can be
  found [here](spank.md).
    

- **Node Health Check**  
  Probably the most comprehensive and lightweight health check tool out there is [LBNL Node Health
  Check](https://github.com/mej/nhc). It has integration with Slurm as well as Torque resource
  managers.
    

- **Accounting Tools**
  - **UBMoD** is a web based tool for displaying accounting data from various resource managers. It
    aggregates the accounting data from sacct into a MySQL data warehouse and provide a front end
    web interface for browsing the data. For more information, see the [UDMod home
    page](http://ubmod.sourceforge.net/resource-manager-slurm.html) and [source
    code](https://github.com/ubccr/ubmod).  
  - [**XDMoD**](http://xdmod.sourceforge.net) (XD Metrics on Demand) is an NSF-funded open source
    tool designed to audit and facilitate the utilization of the XSEDE cyberinfrastructure by
    providing a wide range of metrics on XSEDE resources, including resource utilization, resource
    performance, and impact on scholarship and research.

    

- **STUBL (Slurm Tools and UBiLities)**  
  STUBL is a collection of supplemental tools and utility scripts for Slurm.  
  [STUBL home page](https://github.com/ubccr/stubl).
    

- **pestat**  
  Prints a consolidated compute node status line, with one line per node including a list of jobs.  
  [Home page](https://github.com/OleHolmNielsen/Slurm_tools/tree/master/pestat)
    

- **Graphical Sdiag**  
  The sdiag utility is a diagnostic tool that maintains statistics on Slurm's scheduling
  performance. You can run sdiag periodically or as you modify Slurm's configuration. However if you
  want a historical view of these statistics, you could save them in a time-series database and
  graph them over time as performed with this tool:
  - [A collection of custom diamond collectors to gather various Slurm
    statistics](https://github.com/fasrc/slurm-diamond-collector)
  - [Collectd](https://github.com/collectd/collectd/pull/1198) (for use with
    [jobmetrics](https://github.com/edf-hpc/jobmetrics))
