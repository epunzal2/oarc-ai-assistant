# <span id="top">Consumable Resources in Slurm</span>

Slurm, using the default node allocation plug-in, allocates nodes to jobs in exclusive mode. This
means that even when all the resources within a node are not utilized by a given job, another job
will not have access to these resources. Nodes possess resources such as processors, memory, swap,
local disk, etc. and jobs consume these resources. The exclusive use default policy in Slurm can
result in inefficient utilization of the cluster and of its nodes resources. Slurm's *cons_res* and
*cons_tres* plugins are available to manage resources on a much more fine-grained basis as described
below.

## Using the Consumable Resource Allocation Plugin: **select/cons_res**

- Consumable resources has been enhanced with several new resources --namely CPU (same as in
  previous version), Socket, Core, Memory as well as any combination of the logical processors with
  Memory:
  - **CPU** (*CR_CPU*): CPU as a consumable resource.
    - No notion of sockets, cores, or threads.
    - On a multi-core system CPUs will be cores.
    - On a multi-core/hyperthread system CPUs will be threads.
    - On a single-core system CPUs are CPUs.
  - **Board** (*CR_Board*): Baseboard as a consumable resource.
  - **Socket** (*CR_Socket*): Socket as a consumable resource.
  - **Core** (*CR_Core*): Core as a consumable resource.
  - **Memory** (*CR_Memory*) Memory <u>only</u> as a consumable resource. Note! CR_Memory assumes
    OverSubscribe=Yes
  - **Socket and Memory** (*CR_Socket_Memory*): Socket and Memory as consumable resources.
  - **Core and Memory** (*CR_Core_Memory*): Core and Memory as consumable resources.
  - **CPU and Memory** (*CR_CPU_Memory*) CPU and Memory as consumable resources.
- In the cases where Memory is the consumable resource or one of the two consumable resources the
  **RealMemory** parameter, which defines a node's amount of real memory in slurm.conf, must be set.
- srun's *-E* extension for sockets, cores, and threads are ignored within the node allocation
  mechanism when CR_CPU or CR_CPU_MEMORY is selected. It is considered to compute the total number
  of tasks when -n is not specified.
- The job submission commands (salloc, sbatch and srun) support the options *--mem=MB* and
  *--mem-per-cpu=MB* permitting users to specify the maximum amount of real memory per node or per
  allocated required. This option is required in the environments where Memory is a consumable
  resource. It is important to specify enough memory since Slurm will not allow the application to
  use more than the requested amount of real memory. The default value for --mem is 1 MB. See the
  **srun** man page for more details.
- All CR_s assume **OverSubscribe=No** or **OverSubscribe=Force** EXCEPT for **CR_MEMORY** which
  assumes **OverSubscribe=Yes**.
- The consumable resource plugin is enabled via SelectType and SelectTypeParameters in the
  slurm.conf.

    SelectType=select/cons_res

Using *--overcommit* or *-O* is allowed. When the process to logical processor pinning is enabled by
using an appropriate TaskPlugin configuration parameter, the extra processes will time share the
allocated resources.

## Using the Consumable Trackable Resource Plugin: **select/cons_tres**

- The Consumable Trackable Resources (**cons_tres**) plugin provides all the same functionality
  provided by the Consumable Resources (**cons_res**) plugin. It also includes additional
  functionality specifically related to GPUs.
- Additional parameters available for the **cons_tres** plugin:
  - **DefCpuPerGPU**: Default number of CPUs allocated per GPU.
  - **DefMemPerGPU**: Default amount of memory allocated per GPU.
- Additional job submit options available for the **cons_tres** plugin:
  - **--cpus-per-gpu=**: Number of CPUs for every GPU.
  - **--gpus=**: Count of GPUs for entire job allocation.
  - **--gpu-bind=**: Bind task to specific GPU(s).
  - **--gpu-freq=**: Request specific GPU/memory frequencies.
  - **--gpus-per-node=**: Number of GPUs per node.
  - **--gpus-per-socket=**: Number of GPUs per socket.
  - **--gpus-per-task=**: Number of GPUs per task.
  - **--mem-per-gpu=**: Amount of memory for each GPU.
- The consumable trackable resource plugin is enabled via the SelectType parameter in the
  slurm.conf.

    # Excerpt from sample slurm.conf file
    SelectType=select/cons_tres

## General Comments

- Slurm's default **select/linear** plugin is using a best fit algorithm based on number of
  consecutive nodes. The same node allocation approach is used with **select/cons_res** and
  **select/cons_tres** for consistency.
- The **select/cons_res** and **select/cons_tres** plugins are enabled or disabled cluster-wide.
- In the case where **select/linear** is enabled, the normal Slurm behaviors are not disrupted. The
  major change users see when using the **select/cons_res** or **select/cons_tres** plugins, is that
  jobs can be co-scheduled on nodes when resources permit it. Generic resources (such as GPUs) can
  also be tracked individually with these plugins. The rest of Slurm, such as srun and its options
  (except srun -s ...), etc. are not affected by this plugin. Slurm is, from the user's point of
  view, working the same way as when using the default node selection scheme.
- The *--exclusive* srun option allows users to request nodes in exclusive mode even when consumable
  resources is enabled. See the **srun** man page for details.
- srun's *-s* or *--oversubscribe* is incompatible with the consumable resource environment and will
  therefore not be honored. Since this environment's nodes are shared by default, *--exclusive*
  allows users to obtain dedicated nodes.
- The *--oversubscribe* and *--exclusive* options are mutually exclusive when used at job
  submission. If both options are set when submitting a job, the job submission command used will
  fatal.

## Example of Node Allocations Using Consumable Resource Plugin

The following example illustrates the different ways four jobs are allocated across a cluster using
(1) Slurm's default allocation method (exclusive mode) and (2) a processor as consumable resource
approach.

It is important to understand that the example listed below is a contrived example and is only given
here to illustrate the use of CPU as consumable resources. Job 2 and Job 3 call for the node count
to equal the processor count. This would typically be done because that one task per node requires
all of the memory, disk space, etc. The bottleneck would not be processor count.

Trying to execute more than one job per node will almost certainly severely impact parallel job's
performance. The biggest beneficiary of CPUs as consumable resources will be serial jobs or jobs
with modest parallelism, which can effectively share resources. On many systems with larger
processor count, jobs typically run one fewer task than there are processors to minimize
interference by the kernel and daemons.

The example cluster is composed of 4 nodes (10 CPUs in total):

- linux01 (with 2 processors),
- linux02 (with 2 processors),
- linux03 (with 2 processors), and
- linux04 (with 4 processors).

The four jobs are the following:

- \[2\] srun -n 4 -N 4 sleep 120 &
- \[3\] srun -n 3 -N 3 sleep 120 &
- \[4\] srun -n 1 sleep 120 &
- \[5\] srun -n 3 sleep 120 &

The user launches them in the same order as listed above.

## Using Slurm's Default Node Allocation (Non-shared Mode)

The four jobs have been launched and 3 of the jobs are now pending, waiting to get resources
allocated to them. Only Job 2 is running since it uses one CPU on all 4 nodes. This means that
linux01 to linux03 each have one idle CPU and linux04 has 3 idle CPUs.

    # squeue
    JOBID PARTITION   NAME  USER  ST  TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
        3       lsf  sleep  root  PD  0:00      3 (Resources)
        4       lsf  sleep  root  PD  0:00      1 (Resources)
        5       lsf  sleep  root  PD  0:00      1 (Resources)
        2       lsf  sleep  root   R  0:14      4 xc14n[13-16]

Once Job 2 is finished, Job 3 is scheduled and runs on linux01, linux02, and linux03. Job 3 is only
using one CPU on each of the 3 nodes. Job 4 can be allocated onto the remaining idle node (linux04)
so Job 3 and Job 4 can run concurrently on the cluster.

Job 5 has to wait for idle nodes to be able to run.

    # squeue
    JOBID PARTITION   NAME  USER  ST  TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
        5       lsf  sleep  root  PD  0:00      1 (Resources)
        3       lsf  sleep  root   R  0:11      3 xc14n[13-15]
        4       lsf  sleep  root   R  0:11      1 xc14n16

Once Job 3 finishes, Job 5 is allocated resources and can run.

The advantage of the exclusive mode scheduling policy is that the a job gets all the resources of
the assigned nodes for optimal parallel performance. The drawback is that jobs can tie up large
amount of resources that it does not use and which cannot be shared with other jobs.

## Using a Processor Consumable Resource Approach

The output of squeue shows that we have 3 out of the 4 jobs allocated and running. This is a 2
running job increase over the default Slurm approach.

Job 2 is running on nodes linux01 to linux04. Job 2's allocation is the same as for Slurm's default
allocation which is that it uses one CPU on each of the 4 nodes. Once Job 2 is scheduled and
running, nodes linux01, linux02 and linux03 still have one idle CPU each and node linux04 has 3 idle
CPUs. The main difference between this approach and the exclusive mode approach described above is
that idle CPUs within a node are now allowed to be assigned to other jobs.

It is important to note that *assigned* doesn't mean *oversubscription*. The consumable resource
approach tracks how much of each available resource (in our case CPUs) must be dedicated to a given
job. This allows us to prevent per node oversubscription of resources (CPUs).

Once Job 2 is running, Job 3 is scheduled onto node linux01, linux02, and Linux03 (using one CPU on
each of the nodes) and Job 4 is scheduled onto one of the remaining idle CPUs on Linux04.

Job 2, Job 3, and Job 4 are now running concurrently on the cluster.

    # squeue
    JOBID PARTITION   NAME  USER  ST  TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
        5       lsf  sleep  root  PD  0:00      1 (Resources)
        2       lsf  sleep  root   R  0:13      4 linux[01-04]
        3       lsf  sleep  root   R  0:09      3 linux[01-03]
        4       lsf  sleep  root   R  0:05      1 linux04

    # sinfo -lNe
    NODELIST     NODES PARTITION       STATE CPUS MEMORY TMP_DISK WEIGHT FEATURES REASON
    linux[01-03]     3      lsf*   allocated    2   2981        1      1   (null) none
    linux04          1      lsf*   allocated    4   3813        1      1   (null) none

Once Job 2 finishes, Job 5, which was pending, is allocated available resources and is then running
as illustrated below:

    # squeue
    JOBID PARTITION   NAME  USER  ST  TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
       3       lsf   sleep  root   R  1:58      3 linux[01-03]
       4       lsf   sleep  root   R  1:54      1 linux04
       5       lsf   sleep  root   R  0:02      3 linux[01-03]
    # sinfo -lNe
    NODELIST     NODES PARTITION       STATE CPUS MEMORY TMP_DISK WEIGHT FEATURES REASON
    linux[01-03]     3      lsf*   allocated    2   2981        1      1   (null) none
    linux04          1      lsf*        idle    4   3813        1      1   (null) none

Job 3, Job 4, and Job 5 are now running concurrently on the cluster.

    # squeue
    JOBID PARTITION   NAME  USER  ST  TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
        5       lsf  sleep  root   R  1:52      3 linux[01-03]

Job 3 and Job 4 have finished and Job 5 is still running on nodes linux\[01-03\].

The advantage of the consumable resource scheduling policy is that the job throughput can increase
dramatically. The overall job throughput and productivity of the cluster increases, thereby reducing
the amount of time users have to wait for their job to complete as well as increasing the overall
efficiency of the use of the cluster. The drawback is that users do not have entire nodes dedicated
to their jobs by default.

We have added the *"--exclusive"* option to srun (see the **srun** man page for more details), which
allows users to specify that they would like their nodes to be allocated in exclusive mode. This is
to accommodate users who might have mpi/threaded/openMP programs that will take advantage of all the
CPUs on a node but only need one mpi process per node.
