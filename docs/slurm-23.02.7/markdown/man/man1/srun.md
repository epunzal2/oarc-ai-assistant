# NAME

srun - Run parallel jobs

# SYNOPSIS

**srun** \[*OPTIONS(0)*... \[*executable(0)* \[*args(0)*...\]\]\] \[ : \[*OPTIONS(N)*...\]\]
*executable(N)* \[*args(N)*...\]

Option(s) define multiple jobs in a co-scheduled heterogeneous job. For more details about
heterogeneous jobs see the document  
https://slurm.schedmd.com/heterogeneous_jobs.html

# DESCRIPTION

Run a parallel job on cluster managed by Slurm. If necessary, srun will first create a resource
allocation in which to run the parallel job.

The following document describes the influence of various options on the allocation of cpus to jobs
and tasks.  
https://slurm.schedmd.com/cpu_management.html

# RETURN VALUE

srun will return the highest exit code of all tasks run or the highest signal (with the high-order
bit set in an 8-bit integer -- e.g. 128 + signal) of any task that exited with a signal.  
The value 253 is reserved for out-of-memory errors.

# EXECUTABLE PATH RESOLUTION

The executable is resolved in the following order:  

1\. If executable starts with ".", then path is constructed as: current working directory /
executable  
2. If executable starts with a "/", then path is considered absolute.  
3. If executable can be resolved through PATH. See **path_resolution**(7).  
4. If executable is in current working directory.  

Current working directory is the calling process working directory unless the **--chdir** argument
is passed, which will override the current working directory.

# OPTIONS

**--accel-bind**=\<*options*\>  
Control how tasks are bound to generic resources of type gpu and nic. Multiple options may be
specified. Supported options include:

> **g**  
> Bind each task to GPUs which are closest to the allocated CPUs.
>
> <!-- -->
>
> **n**  
> Bind each task to NICs which are closest to the allocated CPUs.
>
> <!-- -->
>
> **v**  
> Verbose mode. Log how tasks are bound to GPU and NIC devices.
>
> <!-- -->
>
> This option applies to job allocations.  
>
> <!-- -->
>
> **-A**, **--account**=\<*account*\>  
> Charge resources used by this job to specified account. The *account* is an arbitrary string. The
> account name may be changed after job submission using the **scontrol** command. This option
> applies to job allocations.
>
> <!-- -->
>
> **--acctg-freq**=\<*datatype*\>=\<*interval*\>\[,\<*datatype*\>=\<*interval*\>...\]  
> Define the job accounting and profiling sampling intervals in seconds. This can be used to
> override the *JobAcctGatherFrequency* parameter in the slurm.conf file.
> \<*datatype*\>=\<*interval*\> specifies the task sampling interval for the jobacct_gather plugin
> or a sampling interval for a profiling type by the acct_gather_profile plugin. Multiple

> are:
>
> > **task**  
> > Sampling interval for the jobacct_gather plugins and for task profiling by the
> > acct_gather_profile plugin.  
> > **NOTE**: This frequency is used to monitor memory usage. If memory limits are enforced the
> > highest frequency a user can request is what is configured in the slurm.conf file. It can not be
> > disabled.

> > **filesystem**  
> > Sampling interval for filesystem profiling using the acct_gather_filesystem plugin.
> >
> > The default value for the task sampling interval is 30 seconds. The default value for all other
> > intervals is 0. An interval of 0 disables sampling of the specified type. If the task sampling
> > interval is 0, accounting information is collected only at job termination (reducing Slurm
> > interference with the job).  
> > Smaller (non-zero) values have a greater impact upon job performance, but a value of 30 seconds

> **--bb**=\<*spec*\>  
> Burst buffer specification. The form of the specification is system dependent. Also see **--bbf**.

> **block**

> (i.e. the job allocation can not share nodes with other running jobs), the job is allocated all
> CPUs and GRES on all nodes in the allocation, but is only allocated as much memory as it
> requested. This is by design to support gang scheduling, because suspended jobs still reside in
> memory. To request all the memory on a node, use **--mem=0**. The default shared/exclusive
> behavior depends on system configuration and the partition's **OverSubscribe** option takes
> precedence over the job's option. **NOTE**: Since shared GRES (MPS) cannot be allocated at the
> same time as a sharing GRES (GPU) this option only allocates all sharing GRES and no underlying
> shared GRES.
>
> This option can also be used when initiating more than one job step within an existing resource

Executing **srun** sends a remote procedure call to **slurmctld**. If enough calls from **srun** or
other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to the **slurmctld** daemon come in at
once, it can result in a degradation of performance of the **slurmctld** daemon, possibly resulting
in a denial of service.

Do not run **srun** or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to **slurmctld**
from loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to **srun** to the
minimum necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

# INPUT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Upon startup, srun will read and handle the options set in the following environment variables. The
majority of these variables are set the same way the options are set, as defined above. For flag
options that are defined to expect no argument, the option can be enabled by setting the environment
variable without a value (empty or NULL string), the string 'yes', or a non-zero number. Any other
value for the environment variable will result in the option not being set. There are a couple
exceptions to these rules that are noted below.  
**NOTE**: Command line options always override environment variable settings.

**PMI_FANOUT**  
This is used exclusively with PMI (MPICH2 and MVAPICH2) and controls the fanout of data
communications. The srun command sends messages to application programs (via the PMI library) and
those applications may be called upon to forward that data to up to this number of additional tasks.
Higher values offload work from the srun command to the applications and likely increase the
vulnerability to failures. The default value is 32.

<!-- -->

**PMI_FANOUT_OFF_HOST**  
This is used exclusively with PMI (MPICH2 and MVAPICH2) and controls the fanout of data
communications. The srun command sends messages to application programs (via the PMI library) and
those applications may be called upon to forward that data to additional tasks. By default, srun
sends one message per host and one task on that host forwards the data to other tasks on that host
up to **PMI_FANOUT**. If **PMI_FANOUT_OFF_HOST** is defined, the user task may be required to
forward the data to tasks on other hosts. Setting **PMI_FANOUT_OFF_HOST** may increase performance.
Since more work is performed by the PMI library loaded by the user application, failures also can be
more common and more difficult to diagnose. Should be disabled/enabled by setting to 0 or 1.

<!-- -->

**PMI_TIME**  
This is used exclusively with PMI (MPICH2 and MVAPICH2) and controls how much the communications
from the tasks to the srun are spread out in time in order to avoid overwhelming the srun command
with work. The default value is 500 (microseconds) per task. On relatively slow processors or
systems with very large processor counts (and large PMI data sets), higher values may be required.

# OUTPUT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

srun will set some environment variables in the environment of the executing tasks on the remote
compute nodes. These environment variables are:

**SLURM\_\*\_HET_GROUP\_#**  
For a heterogeneous job allocation, the environment variables are set separately for each component.

<!-- -->

**SLURM_CLUSTER_NAME**  
Name of the cluster on which the job is executing.

<!-- -->

**SLURM_CPU_BIND_LIST**  
**--cpu-bind** map or mask list (list of Slurm CPU IDs or masks for this node, CPU_ID = Board_ID x
threads_per_board + Socket_ID x threads_per_socket + Core_ID x threads_per_core + Thread_ID).

<!-- -->

**SLURM_CPU_BIND_TYPE**  
**--cpu-bind** type (none,rank,map_cpu:,mask_cpu:).

<!-- -->

**SLURM_CPU_BIND_VERBOSE**  
**--cpu-bind** verbosity (quiet,verbose).

<!-- -->

**SLURM_CPU_FREQ_REQ**  
Contains the value requested for cpu frequency on the srun command as a numerical frequency in
kilohertz, or a coded value for a request of *low*, *medium*,*highm1* or *high* for the frequency.
See the description of the **--cpu-freq** option or the **SLURM_CPU_FREQ_REQ** input environment
variable.

<!-- -->

**SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE**  
Number of CPUs available to the step on this node. **NOTE**: The **select/linear** plugin allocates
entire nodes to jobs, so the value indicates the total count of CPUs on the node. For the
**select/cons_res** and **cons/tres** plugins, this number indicates the number of CPUs on this node
allocated to the step.

<!-- -->

**SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK**  
Number of cpus requested per task. Only set if the **--cpus-per-task** option is specified.

<!-- -->

if Slurm was built with pmi support. Leaving the variable set may cause problems when using external
packages from within the job (Abaqus and Ansys have been known to have problems when it is set -
consult the appropriate documentation for 3rd party software).

<!-- -->

**SLURM_HET_SIZE**  
Set to count of components in heterogeneous job.

SLURM_JOB_NODELIST) the allocation has 72 CPUs, while the third node has 36 CPUs. **NOTE**: The
**select/linear** plugin allocates entire nodes to jobs, so the value indicates the total count of
CPUs on allocated nodes. The **select/cons_res** and **select/cons_tres** plugins allocate
individual CPUs to jobs, so this number indicates the number of CPUs allocated to the job.

followed by "(x#)" where "#" is the repetition count. For example, "SLURM_TASKS_PER_NODE=2(x3),1"
indicates that the first three nodes will each execute two tasks and the fourth node will execute
one task.

<!-- -->

The *umask* in effect when the job was submitted.

<!-- -->

**SLURMD_NODENAME**  
Name of the node running the task. In the case of a parallel job executing on multiple compute
nodes, the various tasks will have this environment variable set to different values on each compute
node.

<!-- -->

**SRUN_DEBUG**  
Set to the logging level of the **srun** command. Default value is 3 (info level). The value is
incremented or decremented based upon the **--verbose** and **--quiet** options.

# SIGNALS AND ESCAPE SEQUENCES

Signals sent to the **srun** command are automatically forwarded to the tasks it is controlling with
a few exceptions. The escape sequence **\<control-c\>** will report the state of all tasks
associated with the **srun** command. If **\<control-c\>** is entered twice within one second, then
the associated SIGINT signal will be sent to all tasks and a termination sequence will be entered
sending SIGCONT, SIGTERM, and SIGKILL to all spawned tasks. If a third **\<control-c\>** is
received, the srun program will be terminated without waiting for remote tasks to exit or their I/O
to complete.

The escape sequence **\<control-z\>** is presently ignored.

# MPI SUPPORT

MPI use depends upon the type of MPI being used. There are three fundamentally different modes of
operation used by these various MPI implementations.

1\. Slurm directly launches the tasks and performs initialization of communications through the PMI2
or PMIx APIs. For example: "srun -n16 a.out".

2\. Slurm creates a resource allocation for the job and then mpirun launches tasks using Slurm's
infrastructure (OpenMPI).

3\. Slurm creates a resource allocation for the job and then mpirun launches tasks using some
mechanism other than Slurm, such as SSH or RSH. These tasks are initiated outside of Slurm's
monitoring or control. Slurm's epilog should be configured to purge these tasks when the job's
allocation is relinquished, or the use of pam_slurm_adopt is highly recommended.

See *https://slurm.schedmd.com/mpi_guide.html* for more information on use of these various MPI
implementations with Slurm.

# MULTIPLE PROGRAM CONFIGURATION

Comments in the configuration file must have a "#" in column one. The configuration file contains
the following fields separated by white space:

Task rank  
One or more task ranks to use this configuration. Multiple values may be comma separated. Ranges may
be indicated with two numbers separated with a '-' with the smaller number first (e.g. "0-4" and not
"4-0"). To indicate all tasks not otherwise specified, specify a rank of '\*' as the last line of
the file. If an attempt is made to initiate a task for which no executable program is defined, the
following error message will be produced "No executable program specified for this task".

<!-- -->

Executable  
The name of the program to execute. May be fully qualified pathname if desired.

<!-- -->

Arguments  
Program arguments. The expression "%t" will be replaced with the task's number. The expression "%o"
will be replaced with the task's offset within this range (e.g. a configured task rank value of
"1-5" would have offset values of "0-4"). Single quotes may be used to avoid having the enclosed
values interpreted. This field is optional. Any arguments for the program entered on the command
line will be added to the arguments specified in the configuration file.

For example:

    $ cat silly.conf
    ###################################################################
    # srun multiple program configuration file
    #
    # srun -n8 -l --multi-prog silly.conf
    ###################################################################
    4-6       hostname
    1,7       echo  task:%t
    0,2-3     echo  offset:%o

    $ srun -n8 -l --multi-prog silly.conf
    0: offset:0
    1: task:1
    2: offset:1
    3: offset:2
    4: linux15.llnl.gov
    5: linux16.llnl.gov
    6: linux17.llnl.gov
    7: task:7

# EXAMPLES

**Example 1:**  
This simple example demonstrates the execution of the command **hostname** in eight tasks. At least
eight processors will be allocated to the job (the same as the task count) on however many nodes are
required to satisfy the request. The output of each task will be proceeded with its task number.
(The machine "dev" in the example below has a total of two CPUs per node)

    $ srun -n8 -l hostname
    0: dev0
    1: dev0
    2: dev1
    3: dev1
    4: dev2
    5: dev2
    6: dev3
    7: dev3

<!-- -->

**Example 2:**  
The srun **-r** option is used within a job script to run two job steps on disjoint nodes in the
following example. The script is run using allocate mode instead of as a batch job in this case.

    $ cat test.sh
    #!/bin/sh
    echo $SLURM_JOB_NODELIST
    srun -lN2 -r2 hostname
    srun -lN2 hostname

    $ salloc -N4 test.sh
    dev[7-10]
    0: dev9
    1: dev10
    0: dev7
    1: dev8

**Example 3:**  
The following script runs two job steps in parallel within an allocated set of nodes.

    $ cat test.sh
    #!/bin/bash
    srun -lN2 -n4 -r 2 sleep 60 &
    srun -lN2 -r 0 sleep 60 &
    sleep 1
    squeue
    squeue -s
    wait

    $ salloc -N4 test.sh
      JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER  ST      TIME  NODES NODELIST
      65641     batch  test.sh   grondo   R      0:01      4 dev[7-10]

    STEPID     PARTITION     USER      TIME NODELIST
    65641.0        batch   grondo      0:01 dev[7-8]
    65641.1        batch   grondo      0:01 dev[9-10]

**Example 4:**  
This example demonstrates how one executes a simple MPI job. We use **srun** to build a list of
machines (nodes) to be used by **mpirun** in its required format. A sample command line and the
script to be executed follow.

    $ cat test.sh
    #!/bin/sh
    MACHINEFILE="nodes.$SLURM_JOB_ID"

    # Generate Machinefile for mpi such that hosts are in the same
    #  order as if run via srun
    #
    srun -l /bin/hostname | sort -n | awk '{print $2}' > $MACHINEFILE

    # Run using generated Machine file:
    mpirun -np $SLURM_NTASKS -machinefile $MACHINEFILE mpi-app

    rm $MACHINEFILE

    $ salloc -N2 -n4 test.sh

<!-- -->

**Example 5:**  
This simple example demonstrates the execution of different jobs on different nodes in the same
srun. You can do this for any number of nodes or any number of jobs. The executables are placed on
the nodes sited by the SLURM_NODEID env var. Starting at 0 and going to the number specified on the
srun command line.

    $ cat test.sh
    case $SLURM_NODEID in
        0) echo "I am running on "
           hostname ;;
        1) hostname
           echo "is where I am running" ;;
    esac

    $ srun -N2 test.sh
    dev0
    is where I am running
    I am running on
    dev1

<!-- -->

**Example 6:**  
This example demonstrates use of multi-core options to control layout of tasks. We request that four
sockets per node and two cores per socket be dedicated to the job.

    $ srun -N2 -B 4-4:2-2 a.out

<!-- -->

**Example 7:**  
This example shows a script in which Slurm is used to provide resource management for a job by
executing the various job steps as processors become available for their dedicated use.

    $ cat my.script
    #!/bin/bash
    srun -n4 prog1 &
    srun -n3 prog2 &
    srun -n1 prog3 &
    srun -n1 prog4 &
    wait

<!-- -->

**Example 8:**  
This example shows how to launch an application called "server" with one task, 8 CPUs and 16 GB of
memory (2 GB per CPU) plus another application called "client" with 16 tasks, 1 CPU per task (the
default) and 1 GB of memory per task.

    $ srun -n1 -c16 --mem-per-cpu=1gb server : -n16 --mem-per-cpu=1gb client

<!-- -->

**Example 9:**  
This example highlights the difference in behavior with srun's **--exclusive** and **--overlap**
flags when run from inside a job allocation. The **--overlap** flag allows both steps to start at
the same time. The **--exclusive** flag makes the second step wait until the first has finished.

    $ salloc  -n1
    salloc: Granted job allocation 9553
    salloc: Waiting for resource configuration
    salloc: Nodes node01 are ready for job

    $ date +%T; srun -n1 --overlap -l sleep 3 &
    $ srun -n1 --overlap -l date +%T &
    14:36:04
    [1] 144341
    [2] 144342
    0: 14:36:04
    [2]+  Done                    srun -n1 --overlap -l date +%T
    [1]+  Done                    srun -n1 --overlap -l sleep 3

    $ date +%T; srun -n1 --exclusive -l sleep 3 &
    $ srun -n1 --exclusive -l date +%T &
    14:36:17
    [1] 144429
    [2] 144430
    srun: Job 9553 step creation temporarily disabled, retrying (Requested nodes are busy)
    srun: Step created for job 9553
    0: 14:36:20
    [1]-  Done                    srun -n1 --exclusive -l sleep 3
    [2]+  Done                    srun -n1 --exclusive -l date +%T

<!-- -->

**Example 10:**  
This example demonstrates how jobs that are not evenly split among multiple nodes can run into
problems of tasks not being able to start when there are enough CPUs free to run that task on a
single node. This example shows a job that was allocated 2 CPUs on one node and 24 CPUs on the other
node.

    $ echo $SLURM_NODELIST; echo $SLURM_JOB_CPUS_PER_NODE
    node[01-02]
    2,24

If a task is started that occupies the CPUs on the node with fewer CPUs, then a subsequent task that
should be able to start on the other node will not start because it inherits the requirement for the
number of nodes from the job allocation. The job step will stay pending until the first job step
completes or until it is cancelled.

    $ srun -n4 --exact sleep 1800 &
    [1] 151837

    $ srun -n2 --exact hostname
    ^Csrun: Cancelled pending job step with signal 2
    srun: error: Unable to create step for job 2677: Job/step already completing or completed

If the job step is started, explicitly requesting a single node, then the step is able to run.

    $ srun -n2 -N1 --exact hostname
    node02
    node02

This behavior can be changed by adding **SelectTypeParameters=CR_Pack_Nodes** to your slurm.conf.
The logic to pack nodes will allow job steps to start on a single node without having to explicitly
request a single node.
