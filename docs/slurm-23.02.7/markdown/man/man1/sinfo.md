# NAME

sinfo - View information about Slurm nodes and partitions.

# SYNOPSIS

**sinfo** \[*OPTIONS*...\]

# DESCRIPTION

**sinfo** is used to view partition and node information for a system running Slurm.

# OPTIONS

**-a**, **--all**  
Display information about all partitions. This causes information to be displayed about partitions
that are configured as hidden and partitions that are unavailable to the user's group.

<!-- -->

**-M**, **--clusters**=\<*string*\>  
Clusters to issue commands to. Multiple cluster names may be comma separated. A value of '**all**'
will query all clusters. Note that the **SlurmDBD** must be up for this option to work properly.
This option implicitly sets the **--local** option.

<!-- -->

**-d**, **--dead**  
If set, only report state information for non-responding (dead) nodes.

<!-- -->

**-e**, **--exact**  
If set, do not group node information on multiple nodes unless their configurations to be reported
are identical. Otherwise cpu count, memory size, and disk space for nodes will be listed with the
minimum value followed by a "+" for nodes with the same partition and state (e.g. "250+").

<!-- -->

**--federation**  
Show all partitions from the federation if a member of one.

<!-- -->

**-F**, **--future**  
Report nodes in FUTURE state.

<!-- -->

**-o**, **--format**=\<*output_format*\>  
Specify the information to be displayed using an **sinfo** format string. If the command is executed
in a federated cluster environment and information about more than one cluster is to be displayed
and the **-h, --noheader** option is used, then the cluster name will be displayed before the
default output formats shown below. Format strings transparently used by **sinfo** when running with
various options are:

> *default*  
> "%#P %.5a %.10l %.6D %.6t %N"
>
> <!-- -->
>
> *--summarize*  
> "%#P %.5a %.10l %.16F %N"
>
> <!-- -->
>
> *--long*  
> "%#P %.5a %.10l %.10s %.4r %.8h %.10g %.6D %.11T %.11i %N"
>
> <!-- -->
>
> *--Node*  
> "%#N %.6D %#P %6t"
>
> <!-- -->
>
> *--long --Node*  
> "%#N %.6D %#P %.11T %.4c %.8z %.6m %.8d %.6w %.8f %20E"
>
> <!-- -->
>
> *--list-reasons*  
> "%20E %9u %19H %N"
>
> <!-- -->
>
> *--long --list-reasons*  
> "%20E %12U %19H %6t %N"

In the above format strings, the use of "#" represents the maximum length of any partition name or
node list to be printed. A pass is made over the records to be printed to establish the size in
order to align the sinfo output, then a second pass is made over the records to print them. Note
that the literal character "#" itself is not a valid field length specification, but is only used to
document this behavior.

The format of each field is "%\[\[.\]size\]type\[suffix\]"

> *size*  
> Minimum field size. If no size is specified, whatever is needed to print the information will be
> used.
>
> <!-- -->
>
> *.*  
> Indicates the output should be right justified and size must be specified. By default output is
> left justified.
>
> <!-- -->
>

**-O**, **--Format**=\<*output_format*\>  
Specify the information to be displayed. Also see the **-o \<output_format\>**,
**--format=\<output_format\>** option (which supports greater flexibility in formatting, but does
not support access to all fields because we ran out of letters). Requests a comma separated list of
job information to be displayed.

**--help**  
Print a message describing all **sinfo** options.

<!-- -->

**--hide**  
Do not display information about hidden partitions. Partitions that are configured as hidden or are
not available to the user's group will not be displayed. This is the default behavior.

<!-- -->

**-i**, **--iterate**=\<*seconds*\>  
Print the state on a periodic basis. Sleep for the indicated number of seconds between reports. By
default prints a time stamp with the header.

<!-- -->

--json  
Dump all node information as JSON. All information is dumped, even if it would normally not be.
Formatting options are ignored; however, filtering arguments are still used.

<!-- -->

**-R**, **--list-reasons**  
List reasons nodes are in the down, drained, fail or failing state. When nodes are in these states
Slurm supports the inclusion of a "reason" string by an administrator. This option will display the
first 20 characters of the reason field and list of nodes with that reason for all nodes that are,
by default, down, drained, draining or failing. This option may be used with other node filtering
options (e.g. **-r**, **-d**, **-t**, **-n**), however, combinations of these options that result in
a list of nodes that are not down or drained or failing will not produce any output. When used with
**-l** the output additionally includes the current node state.

<!-- -->

**--local**  
Show only jobs local to this cluster. Ignore other clusters in this federation (if any). Overrides
**--federation**.

<!-- -->

**-l**, **--long**  
Print more detailed information. This is ignored if the **--format** option is specified.

<!-- -->

**--noconvert**  
Don't convert units from their original type (e.g. 2048M won't be converted to 2G).

<!-- -->

**-N**, **--Node**  
Print information in a node-oriented format with one line per node and partition. That is, if a node
belongs to more than one partition, then one line for each node-partition pair will be shown. If
**--partition** is also specified, then only one line per node in this partition is shown. The
default is to print information in a partition-oriented format. This is ignored if the **--format**
option is specified.

<!-- -->

**-n**, **--nodes**=\<*nodes*\>  
Print information about the specified node(s). Multiple nodes may be comma separated or expressed
using a node range expression (e.g. "linux\[00-17\]") Limiting the query to just the relevant nodes
can measurably improve the performance of the command for large clusters.

<!-- -->

**-h**, **--noheader**  
Do not print a header on the output.

<!-- -->

**-p**, **--partition**=\<*partition*\>  
Print information about the node(s) in the specified partition(s). Multiple partitions are separated
by commas.

<!-- -->

**-T**, **--reservation**  
Only display information about Slurm reservations.

**NOTE**: This option causes **sinfo** to ignore most other options, which are focused on partition
and node information.

<!-- -->

**-r**, **--responding**  
If set only report state information for responding nodes.

<!-- -->

**-S**, **--sort**=\<*sort_list*\>  
Specification of the order in which records should be reported. This uses the same field
specification as the \<output_format\>. Multiple sorts may be performed by listing multiple sort
fields separated by commas. The field specifications may be preceded by "+" or "-" for ascending
(default) and descending order respectively. The partition field specification, "P", may be preceded
by a "#" to report partitions in the same order that they appear in Slurm's configuration file,
**slurm.conf**. For example, a sort value of "+P,-m" requests that records be printed in order of
increasing partition name and within a partition by decreasing memory size. The default value of
sort is "#P,-t" (partitions ordered as configured then decreasing node state). If the **--Node**
option is selected, the default sort value is "N" (increasing node name).

<!-- -->

**-t**, **--states**=\<*states*\>  
List nodes only having the given state(s). Multiple states may be comma separated and the comparison
is case insensitive. If the states are separated by '&', then the nodes must be in all states.
Possible values include (case insensitive): ALLOC, ALLOCATED, CLOUD, COMP, COMPLETING, DOWN, DRAIN
(for node in DRAINING or DRAINED states), DRAINED, DRAINING, FAIL, FUTURE, FUTR, IDLE, MAINT, MIX,
MIXED, NO_RESPOND, NPC, PERFCTRS, PLANNED, POWER_DOWN, POWERING_DOWN, POWERED_DOWN, POWERING_UP,
REBOOT_ISSUED, REBOOT_REQUESTED, RESV, RESERVED, UNK, and UNKNOWN. By default nodes in the specified
state are reported whether they are responding or not. The **--dead** and **--responding** options
may be used to filter nodes by the corresponding flag.

<!-- -->

**-s**, **--summarize**  
List only a partition state summary with no node state details. This is ignored if the **--format**
option is specified.

<!-- -->

**--usage**  
Print a brief message listing the **sinfo** options.

<!-- -->

**-v**, **--verbose**  
Provide detailed event logging through program execution.

<!-- -->

**-V**, **--version**  
Print version information and exit.

<!-- -->

--yaml  
Dump all node information as YAML. All information is dumped, even if it would normally not be.
Formatting options are ignored; however, filtering arguments are still used.

# OUTPUT FIELD DESCRIPTIONS

**AVAIL**

minimum and maximum node count are the same. **infinite** is used to identify partitions without a
maximum node count.

<!-- -->

**TIMELIMIT**  
Maximum time limit for any user job in days-hours:minutes:seconds. **infinite** is used to identify
partitions without a job time limit.

(e.g. CPUs). **NO** indicates resources are never oversubscribed. **EXCLUSIVE** indicates whole
nodes are dedicated to jobs (equivalent to srun --exclusive option, may be used even with
select/cons_res managing individual processors). **FORCE** indicates resources are always available
to be oversubscribed. **YES** indicates resource may be oversubscribed, if requested by the job's
resource allocation.

**NOTE**: If OverSubscribe is set to FORCE or YES, the OversubScribe value will be appended to the
output.

<!-- -->

# NODE STATE CODES

Node state codes are shortened as required for the field size. These node states may be followed by
a special character to identify state flags associated with the node. The following node suffixes
and states are used:

**\***  
The node is presently not responding and will not be allocated any new work. If the node remains
non-responsive, it will be placed in the **DOWN** state (except in the case of **COMPLETING**,
**DRAINED**, **DRAINING**, **FAIL**, **FAILING** nodes).

<!-- -->

**~**  
The node is presently in powered off.

<!-- -->

**\#**  
The node is presently being powered up or configured.

<!-- -->

**!**  
The node is pending power down.

<!-- -->

**%**  
The node is presently being powered down.

<!-- -->

**\$**  
The node is currently in a reservation with a flag value of "maintenance".

<!-- -->

**@**  
The node is pending reboot.

<!-- -->

**^**  
The node reboot was issued.

<!-- -->

**-**  
The node is planned by the backfill scheduler for a higher priority job.

<!-- -->

**ALLOCATED**  
The node has been allocated to one or more jobs.

<!-- -->

**ALLOCATED+**  
The node is allocated to one or more active jobs plus one or more jobs are in the process of
COMPLETING.

<!-- -->

**COMPLETING**  
All jobs associated with this node are in the process of COMPLETING. This node state will be removed
when all of the job's processes have terminated and the Slurm epilog program (if any) has
terminated. See the **Epilog** parameter description in the **slurm.conf**(5) man page for more
information.

<!-- -->

**DOWN**  
The node is unavailable for use. Slurm can automatically place nodes in this state if some failure
occurs. System administrators may also explicitly place nodes in this state. If a node resumes
normal operation, Slurm can automatically return it to service. See the **ReturnToService** and
**SlurmdTimeout** parameter descriptions in the **slurm.conf**(5) man page for more information.

<!-- -->

**DRAINED**  
The node is unavailable for use per system administrator request. See the **update node** command in
the **scontrol**(1) man page or the **slurm.conf**(5) man page for more information.

<!-- -->

**DRAINING**  
The node is currently executing a job, but will not be allocated additional jobs. The node state
will be changed to state **DRAINED** when the last job on it completes. Nodes enter this state per
system administrator request. See the **update** node command in the **scontrol**(1) man page or the
**slurm.conf**(5) man page for more information.

<!-- -->

**FAIL**  
The node is expected to fail soon and is unavailable for use per system administrator request. See
the **update node** command in the **scontrol**(1) man page or the **slurm.conf**(5) man page for
more information.

<!-- -->

**FAILING**  
The node is currently executing a job, but is expected to fail soon and is unavailable for use per
system administrator request. See the **update node** command in the **scontrol**(1) man page or the
**slurm.conf**(5) man page for more information.

<!-- -->

**FUTURE**  
The node is currently not fully configured, but expected to be available at some point in the
indefinite future for use.

<!-- -->

**IDLE**  
The node is not allocated to any jobs and is available for use.

<!-- -->

**INVAL**  
The node did not register correctly with the controller. This happens when a node registers with
less resources than configured in the slurm.conf file. The node will clear from this state with a
valid registration (i.e. a slurmd restart is required).

<!-- -->

**MAINT**  
The node is currently in a reservation with a flag value of "maintenance".

<!-- -->

**REBOOT_ISSUED**  
A reboot request has been sent to the agent configured to handle this request.

<!-- -->

**REBOOT_REQUESTED**  
A request to reboot this node has been made, but hasn't been handled yet.

<!-- -->

**MIXED**  
The node has some of its CPUs **ALLOCATED** while others are **IDLE**.

<!-- -->

**PERFCTRS (NPC)**  
Network Performance Counters associated with this node are in use, rendering this node as not usable
for any other jobs

<!-- -->

**PLANNED**  
The node is planned by the backfill scheduler for a higher priority job.

<!-- -->

**POWER_DOWN**  
The node is pending power down.

<!-- -->

**POWERED_DOWN**  
The node is currently powered down and not capable of running any jobs.

<!-- -->

**POWERING_DOWN**  
The node is in the process of powering down and not capable of running any jobs.

<!-- -->

**POWERING_UP**  
The node is in the process of being powered up.

<!-- -->

**RESERVED**  
The node is in an advanced reservation and not generally available.

<!-- -->

**UNKNOWN**  
The Slurm controller has just started and the node's state has not yet been determined.

# PERFORMANCE

Executing **sinfo** sends a remote procedure call to **slurmctld**. If enough calls from **sinfo**
or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to the **slurmctld** daemon come in
at once, it can result in a degradation of performance of the **slurmctld** daemon, possibly
resulting in a denial of service.

Do not run **sinfo** or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to
**slurmctld** from loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to
**sinfo** to the minimum necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Some **sinfo** options may be set via environment variables. These environment variables, along with
their corresponding options, are listed below. **NOTE**: Command line options will always override
these settings.

**SINFO_ALL**  
Same as **-a, --all**

<!-- -->

**SINFO_FEDERATION**  
Same as **--federation**

<!-- -->

**SCONTROL_FUTURE**  
**-F, --future**

<!-- -->

**SINFO_FORMAT**  
Same as **-o \<output_format\>, --format=\<output_format\>**

<!-- -->

**SINFO_LOCAL**  
Same as **--local**

<!-- -->

**SINFO_PARTITION**  
Same as **-p \<partition\>, --partition=\<partition\>**

<!-- -->

**SINFO_SORT**  
Same as **-S \<sort\>, --sort=\<sort\>**

<!-- -->

**SLURM_CLUSTERS**  
Same as **--clusters**

<!-- -->

**SLURM_CONF**  
The location of the Slurm configuration file.

<!-- -->

**SLURM_DEBUG_FLAGS**  
Specify debug flags for sinfo to use. See DebugFlags in the **slurm.conf**(5) man page for a full
list of flags. The environment variable takes precedence over the setting in the slurm.conf.

<!-- -->

**SLURM_TIME_FORMAT**  
Specify the format used to report time stamps. A value of *standard*, the default value, generates
output in the form "year-month-dateThour:minute:second". A value of *relative* returns only
"hour:minute:second" if the current day. For other dates in the current year it prints the
"hour:minute" preceded by "Tomorr" (tomorrow), "Ystday" (yesterday), the name of the day for the
coming week (e.g. "Mon", "Tue", etc.), otherwise the date (e.g. "25 Apr"). For other years it
returns a date month and year without a time (e.g. "6 Jun 2012"). All of the time stamps use a 24
hour format.

A valid strftime() format can also be specified. For example, a value of "%a %T" will report the day
of the week and a time stamp (e.g. "Mon 12:34:56").

# EXAMPLES

Report basic node and partition configurations:  
    $ sinfo
    PARTITION AVAIL TIMELIMIT NODES STATE  NODELIST

<!-- -->

Report partition summary information:  
    $ sinfo -s
    PARTITION AVAIL TIMELIMIT NODES(A/I/O/T) NODELIST
    batch     up     infinite 2/6/0/8        adev[8-15]
    debug*    up        30:00 0/8/0/8        adev[0-7]

<!-- -->

Report more complete information about the partition debug:  
    $ sinfo --long --partition=debug
    PARTITION AVAIL TIMELIMIT JOB_SIZE ROOT OVERSUBS GROUPS NODES STATE NODELIST
    debug*    up        30:00        8 no   no       all        8 idle  dev[0-7]

<!-- -->

Report only those nodes that are in state DRAINED:  
    $ sinfo --states=drained
    PARTITION AVAIL NODES TIMELIMIT STATE  NODELIST
    debug*    up        2     30:00 drain  adev[6-7]

<!-- -->

Report node-oriented information with details and exact matches:  
    $ sinfo -Nel
    NODELIST    NODES PARTITION STATE  CPUS MEMORY TMP_DISK WEIGHT FEATURES REASON
