# NAME

slurmd - The compute node daemon for Slurm.

# SYNOPSIS

**slurmd** \[*OPTIONS*...\]

# DESCRIPTION

**slurmd** is the compute node daemon of Slurm. It monitors all tasks running on the compute node ,
accepts work (tasks), launches tasks, and kills running tasks upon request.

# OPTIONS

**--authinfo**  
Used with configless to set an alternate AuthInfo parameter to be used to establish communication
with slurmctld before the configuration file has been retrieved. (E.g., to specify an alternate
MUNGE socket location.)

<!-- -->

**-b**  
Report node rebooted when daemon restarted. Used for testing purposes.

<!-- -->

**-c**  
Clear system locks as needed. This may be required if **slurmd** terminated abnormally.

<!-- -->

**-C**  
Print the actual hardware configuration (not the configuration from the slurm.conf file) and exit.
The format of output is the same as used in **slurm.conf** to describe a node's configuration plus
its uptime.

<!-- -->

**--conf \<node parameters\>**  
Used in conjunction with the **-Z** option. Used to override or define additional parameters of a
dynamic node using the same syntax and parameters used to define nodes in the slurm.conf. Specifying
any of **CPUs**, **Boards**, **SocketsPerBoard**, **CoresPerSocket** or **ThreadsPerCore** will
override the defaults defined by the **-C** option. **NodeName** and **Port** are not supported.

  
For example if *slurmd -C* reports

<!-- -->

    NodeName=node1 CPUs=16 Boards=1 SocketsPerBoard=1 CoresPerSocket=8 ThreadsPerCore=2 RealMemory=31848

the following --conf specifications will generate the corresponding node definitions:

    --conf "Gres=gpu:2"
    NodeName=node1 CPUs=16 Boards=1 SocketsPerBoard=1 CoresPerSocket=8 ThreadsPerCore=2 RealMemory=31848 Gres=gpu:2

    --conf "RealMemory=30000"
    NodeName=node1 CPUs=16 Boards=1 SocketsPerBoard=1 CoresPerSocket=8 ThreadsPerCore=2 RealMemory=30000

    --conf "CPUs=16"
    NodeName=node1 CPUs=16 RealMemory=331848

    --conf "CPUs=16 RealMemory=30000 Gres=gpu:2"
    NodeName=node1 CPUs=16 RealMemory=30000 Gres=gpu:2"

**--conf-server \<host\>\[:\<port\>\]**  
Comma-separated list of controllers, the first being the primary slurmctld. A port can (optionally)
be specified for each controller. These hosts are where the slurmd will fetch the configuration from
when running in "configless" mode.

<!-- -->

**-d \<file\>**  
Specify the fully qualified pathname to the **slurmstepd** program to be used for shepherding user
job steps. This can be useful for testing purposes.

<!-- -->

**-D**  
Run slurmd in the foreground. Error and debug messages will be copied to stderr.

<!-- -->

**-f \<file\>**  
Read configuration from the specified file. See **NOTES** below.

<!-- -->

**-F\[feature\]**  
Start this node as a Dynamic Future node. It will try to match a node definition with a state of
**FUTURE**, optionally using the specified feature to match the node definition.

<!-- -->

**-G**  
Print Generic RESource (GRES) configuration (based upon slurm.conf GRES merged with gres.conf
contents for this node) and exit.

<!-- -->

**-h**  
Help; print a brief summary of command options.

<!-- -->

**-L \<file\>**  
Write log messages to the specified file.

<!-- -->

**-M**  
Lock slurmd pages into system memory using mlockall (2) to disable paging of the slurmd process.
This may help in cases where nodes are marked DOWN during periods of heavy swap activity. If the
mlockall (2) system call is not available, an error will be printed to the log and slurmd will
continue as normal.

It is suggested to set **LaunchParameters=slurmstepd_memlock** in **slurm.conf**(5) when setting
**-M**.

<!-- -->

**-n \<value\>**  
Set the daemon's nice value to the specified value, typically a negative number. Also note the
**PropagatePrioProcess** configuration parameter.

<!-- -->

**-N \<nodename\>**  
Run the daemon with the given nodename. Used to emulate a larger system with more than one slurmd
daemon per node. Requires that Slurm be built using the --enable-multiple-slurmd configure option.

<!-- -->

**-s**  
Change working directory of slurmd to SlurmdLogFile path if possible, or to SlurmdSpoolDir
otherwise. If both of them fail it will fallback to /var/tmp.

<!-- -->

**-v**  
Verbose operation. Multiple -v's increase verbosity.

<!-- -->

**-V**, **--version**  
Print version information and exit.

<!-- -->

**-Z**  
Start this node as a Dynamic Normal node. If no **--conf** is specified, then the slurmd will
register with the same hardware configuration as defined by the **-C** option.

# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The following environment variables can be used to override settings compiled into slurmd.

**SLURM_CONF**  
The location of the Slurm configuration file. This is overridden by explicitly naming a
configuration file on the command line.

<!-- -->

**SLURM_DEBUG_FLAGS**  
Specify debug flags for slurmd to use. See DebugFlags in the **slurm.conf**(5) man page for a full
list of flags. The environment variable takes precedence over the setting in the slurm.conf.

# SIGNALS

**SIGTERM SIGINT**  
**slurmd** will shutdown cleanly, waiting for in-progress rollups to finish.

<!-- -->

**SIGHUP**  
Reloads the slurm configuration files, similar to 'scontrol reconfigure'.

<!-- -->

**SIGUSR2**  
Reread the log level from the configs, and then reopen the log file. This should be used when
setting up **logrotate**(8).

<!-- -->

**SIGPIPE**  
This signal is explicitly ignored.

# CORE FILE LOCATION

If slurmd is started with the **-D** option then the core file will be written to the current
working directory. Otherwise if **SlurmdLogFile** is a fully qualified path name (starting with a
slash), the core file will be written to the same directory as the log file. Otherwise the core file
will be written to the **SlurmdSpoolDir** directory, or "/var/tmp/" as a last resort. If none of the
above directories can be written, no core file will be produced.

# NOTES

It may be useful to experiment with different **slurmd** specific configuration parameters using a
distinct configuration file (e.g. timeouts). However, this special configuration file will not be
used by the **slurmctld** daemon or the Slurm programs, unless you specifically tell each of them to
use it. If you desire changing communication ports, the location of the temporary file system, or
other parameters used by other Slurm components, change the common configuration file,
**slurm.conf**.

If you are using configless mode with a login node that runs a lot of client commands, you may
consider running **slurmd** on that machine so it can manage a cached version of the configuration
files. Otherwise, each client command will use the DNS record to contact the controller and get the
configuration information, which could place additional load on the controller.
