# NAME

slurmdbd - Slurm Database Daemon.

# SYNOPSIS

**slurmdbd** \[*OPTIONS*...\]

# DESCRIPTION

**slurmdbd** provides a secure enterprise-wide interface to a database for Slurm. This is
particularly useful for archiving accounting records.

# OPTIONS

**-D**  
Run **slurmdbd** in the foreground with logging copied to stdout.

<!-- -->

**-h**  
Help; print a brief summary of command options.

<!-- -->

**-n \<value\>**  
Set the daemon's nice value to the specified value, typically a negative number.

<!-- -->

**-R\[comma separated cluster name list\]**  
Reset the lft and rgt values of the associations in the given cluster list. Lft and rgt values are
used to distinguish hierarchical groups in the slurm accounting database. This option should be very
rarely used.

<!-- -->

**-s**  
Change working directory of slurmdbd to LogFile path if possible, or to /var/tmp otherwise.

<!-- -->

**-v**  
Verbose operation. Multiple **v**'s can be specified, with each '**v**' beyond the first increasing
verbosity, up to 6 times (i.e. -vvvvvv).

<!-- -->

**-V**  
Print version information and exit.

# CORE FILE LOCATION

If slurmdbd is started with the **-D** option then the core file will be written to the current
working directory. Otherwise if **LogFile** in "slurmdbd.conf" is a fully qualified path name
(starting with a slash), the core file will be written to the same directory as the log file,
provided SlurmUser has write permission on the directory. Otherwise the core file will be written to
"/var/tmp/" as a last resort. If neither of the above directories have write permission for
SlurmUser, no core file will be produced.

# SIGNALS

**SIGTERM SIGINT**  
**slurmdbd** will shutdown cleanly, waiting for in-progress rollups to finish.

<!-- -->

**SIGABRT**  
**slurmdbd** will perform a core dump, then exit. In-progress operations are killed.

<!-- -->

**SIGHUP**  
Reloads the slurm configuration files, similar to 'scontrol reconfigure'.

<!-- -->

**SIGUSR2**  
Reread the log level from the configs, and then reopen the log file. This should be used when
setting up **logrotate**(8).

<!-- -->

**SIGCHLD SIGUSR1 SIGTSTP SIGXCPU SIGQUIT SIGPIPE SIGALRM**  
These signals are explicitly ignored.

# NOTES

It may be useful to experiment with different **slurmctld** specific configuration parameters using
a distinct configuration file (e.g. timeouts). However, this special configuration file will not be
used by the **slurmd** daemon or the Slurm programs, unless you specifically tell each of them to
use it. If you desire changing communication ports, the location of the temporary file system, or
other parameters used by other Slurm components, change the common configuration file,
**slurm.conf**.
