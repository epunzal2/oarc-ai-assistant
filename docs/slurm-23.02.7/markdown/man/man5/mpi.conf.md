# NAME

mpi.conf - Slurm configuration file to allow the configuration of MPI plugins.

# DESCRIPTION

**mpi.conf** is an ASCII file which defines parameters that control the behavior of MPI plugins.
Currently the configuration file can only be used to configure the PMIx plugin, but it can be
extended to support other MPI plugins as well. The file will always be located in the same directory
as the **slurm.conf**. This file is optional.

Parameter names are case insensitive. Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line. Changes to the configuration file take effect upon
restart of Slurm daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution of the command "scontrol
reconfigure" unless otherwise noted.

Settings from this configuration file can be viewed in the output of "scontrol show config". This
configuration file can be included when using "configless" mode. Information from mpi.conf is read
at startup or upon reconfigure by slurmctld and slurmd. Instances of slurmstepd for batch steps will
receive information about the plugin requested from slurmd.

# PARAMETERS

**PMIxCliTmpDirBase**=\<*path*\>  
Directory to have PMIx use for temporary files. Defaults to not being set.

<!-- -->

**PMIxCollFence**={mixed\|tree\|ring}  
Define the type of fence to use for collecting inter-node data. Defaults to not being set. See also
**PMIxFenceBarrier**.

<!-- -->

**PMIxDebug**={0\|1}  
Enable debug logging for the PMIx plugin. Defaults to 0.

<!-- -->

**PMIxDirectConn**={true\|false}  
Disable direct launching of tasks. Default is "true".

<!-- -->

**PMIxDirectConnEarly**={true\|false}  
Allow early connections to a parent node. Defaults to "false".

<!-- -->

**PMIxDirectConnUCX**={true\|false}  
Allow PMIx to use UCX for communication. Defaults to "false".

<!-- -->

**PMIxDirectSameArch**={true\|false}  
Enable additional communication optimizations when **PMIxDirectConn** is set to true, assuming all
the job's nodes have the same architecture. Defaults to "false".

<!-- -->

**PMIxEnv**=\<*environment variables*\>  
Semicolon separated list of environment variables to be set in job environments to be used by PMIx.
Defaults to not being set.

<!-- -->

**PMIxFenceBarrier**={true\|false}  
Define whether to fence inter-node communication for data collection. Default is "false". See also
**PMIxCollFence**.

<!-- -->

**PMIxNetDevicesUCX**=\<*device type*\>  
Type of network device to use for communication. Defaults to not being set.

<!-- -->

**PMIxTimeout**=\<*time*\>  
The maximum time (in seconds) allowed for communication between hosts to take place. Defaults to 300
seconds.

<!-- -->

**PMIxTlsUCX**=\<*tl1*\>\[,\<*tl2*\>...\]  
Sets the UCX_TLS variable which restricts the transports to use. The accepted values are defined in
the UCX documentation and may vary between installations. Multiple values can be set and must be
separated by commas. If not set, UCX tries to use all available transports and selects the best ones
according to their performance capabilities and scale. Defaults to not being set.
